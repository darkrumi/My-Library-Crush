Today weather is unconventionally sweet but the gestures she does while studying are more sweet and cute. I don't know what am I feeling right now. Is it because all my friends has or had girlfriends and its just a FOMO or I am literally crushing on her. How do I find it out???? Someone please help me. Let me try to paint a picture of her. Where should I start... let me think... Okay... Oval shape face, black hair, wavy, medium to thick eyebrows, eyes: normal size, round shape, black color, medium eye hairs or whatever it is said; nose: small, round not flat, and medium size not too big or too small, I can't see her lips, they are covered with mask, skinny body as I can see collar bone, normal breasts I guess I don't know tbh. Let me one more detail about her hair, her hair styles is quiet likeable. She has split in the middle of her hair line but a shallow one and this hairs are forming bangs. I think it looks cute tbh.
